# Modulo Operator

#The Modulo Operator Often you'll want to know what is the remainder after a division. e.g. 4 รท 2 = 2 with no remainder but 5 รท 2 = 2 with 1 remainder The modulo does not give you the result of the division, just the remainder. It can be really helpful in certain situations,e.g. figuring out if a number is odd or even

print(5 % 2)
print(8 % 2)
